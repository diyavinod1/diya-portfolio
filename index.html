            <h1 class="section-title">About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello there! 👋 I’m Diya Vinod — a curious explorer of code, creativity, and everything in between. I’m a first-year Computer Science student at <b>Kalaignarkarunanidhi Institute of Technology</b>, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (a.k.a. the future!).</p>
            <p>From debugging Python scripts to designing Canva slides, I thrive at the intersection of logic and imagination. Every day, I wake up excited to learn something new — whether it's writing my first automation script or experimenting with AI tools that turn imagination into visuals.</p>
            <p>Outside the classroom, I’m constantly tinkering — creating reels, sketching random ideas, editing videos with quirky effects, or building fun side projects that keep me awake way past bedtime. I believe learning doesn’t stop at subjects — it’s in the stories, visuals, tools, and memes we create!</p>
            <p>This portfolio? It’s more than a collection of skills. It’s a reflection of my journey so far and the exciting roadmap ahead. Scroll through — and if you relate, let’s connect!</p>

        <section id="skills">
            <h1 class="section-title">Skills</h1>
            <p>⚙️ <b>Programming Languages</b><br>
  I speak the language of logic. Python is my best friend — simple, powerful, and always fun to work with. I also dabble in C, HTML, and CSS — the building blocks that shape the digital world.</p>
            <p>🛠️ <b>Tools & Software</b><br>
  VS Code is my home. Canva is my creative playground. Google Sheets? That's my brain's extension for organizing chaos into clarity.</p>
            <p>🤖 <b>AI & Automation</b><br>
  Whether it’s writing a killer ChatGPT prompt or crafting AI visuals with Leonardo or PixVerse, I love exploring the potential of machines thinking smart.</p>
            <p>🎬 <b>Content Creation</b><br>
  Video editing? I’m all in. Memes? Yes, I create those too — sometimes relatable, sometimes ridiculous, always scroll-stopping.</p>
            <p>💡 <b>Soft Skills</b><br>
  Communication, adaptability, problem-solving, and an unstoppable thirst for learning — these aren’t just buzzwords, they’re the tools I use every single day.</p>

            <h1 class="section-title"> Certifications </h1>
            <p> </p>
            <p>I'm a firm believer that learning doesn’t need to be confined to classrooms. That’s why I’ve taken online deep dives into areas that excite me. Here are a few highlights from my certificate wall:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>🧠 "Get Started with Python" by Google (Coursera) — where it all began!</li>
                <li>🌐 "HTML & CSS Crash Course" (Scrimba x Coursera) — because front-end is just too much fun.</li>
                <li>📊 "Spreadsheets for Beginners" using Google Sheets — turns out data can be kind of addictive.</li>
                <li>🤖 "Basic Image Classification with TensorFlow" — baby steps into deep learning.</li>
                <li>🧬 "Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning" (IBM) — a glimpse into the brain of machines.</li>
                <li>💻 "Problem Solving Through Programming in C" — an NPTEL classic every engineer should go through.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <p> </p>
            <p>My brain doesn't switch off after code — it just changes gears. 😄</p>
            <ul>
                <li>🎨 Sketching — From classroom doodles to full-blown character art, my pencil's seen it all.</li>
                <li>📽️ Editing short videos — Because life looks better in transitions and slow-mo.</li>
                <li>🧠 Exploring AI tools — I love testing tools that turn words into pictures or automate the impossible.</li>
                <li>📚 Reading — Especially fiction and anything that boosts your mindset. A good book is a portal, not just pages.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="lang">
            <h1 class="section-title"> Languages </h1>
            <p> </p>
            <p>My brain is a multilingual playground. Here's how I picked up the languages I know:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>🇬🇧 <b>English</b> — The language of school, learning, and now code comments too!</li>
                <li>🇮🇳 <b>Malayalam</b> — My mother tongue and the voice of home. From lullabies to life lessons.</li>
                <li>🇮🇳 <b>Tamil</b> — Picked up during my school years in Tamil Nadu. It grew on me like filter coffee and Pongal.</li>
                <li>🇮🇳 <b>Hindi</b> — Thanks to my early years in New Delhi, I still say "theek hai" before "okay."</li>
                <li>🇮🇳 <b>Kannada</b> — I don’t speak fluently, but after 4 years in Bangalore, I know enough to smile and say "Channagide!"</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="current">
            <h1 class="section-title">Currently Learning</h1>
            <p>My learning playlist is always on shuffle! 🎧 Here's what I'm currently deep diving into:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>⚔️ C++ — because competitive programming needs that extra speed boost.</li>
                <li>🎨 Frontend Development — learning to make things not just work, but *wow*.</li>
                <li>🚀 Competitive Programming — logic puzzles and brain teasers are my idea of fun.</li>
                <li>🌐 Django — I’m learning to go from “Hello World” to full-stack web wizardry.</li>
            </ul>
